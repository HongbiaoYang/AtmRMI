We tested our program throughly. The test cases include:
1. Establish the server  
	When we establish the server, we type on the command line:
	java bankServer 6666
	Then the server is established and shows "Server is running"

2. Test if the client can connect with the server. When the host name or port number is wrong, the program should be able to output error message.

3. Test if the operation of inquiry, deposit, withdraw, and transfer perform correctly. For example, if the program can correctly output the account balance when client does an "inquiry" operation, if the program can correctly withdraw, transfer, or deposit the money in the account when client does a "withdraw", "transfer", or "deposit" operation. 

4. Test strange scenario. For example, the requested user account does not exist when user wants to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money, or get the account balance. The program will output "No such user or account, 1290!".

5. When the amount of money is less than the withdrawal or transfer amount, the program will output "No sufficeint fund in account 1009!".

6. If the client's command does not follow the specified format, the program will signal the correct command line format according the client's operation.

7. Test that negative money amount is not allowed. When the client want to deposit, transfer, or withdraw negative amount of money, the program will ouput "Illegal amount! Please make sure your amount is positive! Amount= -4".


We did 56 tests on the client side as shown below:
